Created an intelligent design system that adapts to user behavior and generates optimized component variations. Uses machine learning to predict accessibility issues and suggest improvements.

## Core Features

- **Behavioral Adaptation**: Components adjust based on user interaction patterns
- **Accessibility Prediction**: ML model identifies potential WCAG violations before deployment
- **Variant Generation**: Automatically creates responsive and theme variations
- **Figma Sync**: Two-way synchronization with design files

## Impact

Reduced design-to-code handoff time by 60% and eliminated 90% of accessibility issues before QA.
