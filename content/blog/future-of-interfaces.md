The screen has always been a lie. It pretends to be a flat piece of paper, but it is a window into an infinite space. When we treat it like paper, we constrain our thinking to margins and folds.

## Breaking the Frame

In the arcade era, interfaces were unconstrained. They were playful, responsive, and immersive. Then came the "corporate web" - grids, sidebars, and hero sections. Efficient, yes. Boring? Absolutely.

> "Magic happens when the interface dissolves, and only the interaction remains."

We are now entering a new era. With the power of modern GPUs in every pocket, we can afford to be wasteful with pixels if it means being respectful of attention. Motion is not decoration; it is information. Depth is not a gimmick; it is hierarchy.

## The Protocol

1. Make it fast.
2. Make it alive.
3. Make it meaningful.
