Buttons are training wheels. They exist because we needed to translate physical world affordances to screens. But in spatial computing, we can detect intention without requiring explicit commits.

## Natural Interaction

Hover becomes interest. Dwell becomes selection. Pull becomes navigation. The interface reads micro-gestures and responds proportionally. This is not about removing buttons entirely - it's about making them optional for power users while keeping them available for newcomers.

## The Spectrum of Commitment

Not all actions are equal. Deleting a file requires more commitment than scrolling a feed. The interface should modulate its friction accordingly:

- **Zero commitment**: Browsing, previewing, exploring
- **Low commitment**: Liking, bookmarking, minor edits
- **High commitment**: Publishing, deleting, purchasing

Gestures excel at the low end. Explicit confirmation remains appropriate at the high end.

## Designing for Intent

The challenge is disambiguation. When a user hovers, are they reading or selecting? The answer lies in duration, movement patterns, and context. Machine learning can help, but simple heuristics go a long way.
