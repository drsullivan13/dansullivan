## Synthesis Protocol

1. Initialize heating sequence on Wok unit to 400°F.

2. Deploy curry paste into heated oil. Sauté until aromatic sensors detect peak fragrance (approx 2 min).

3. Slowly inject coconut milk while maintaining constant agitation to prevent separation.

4. Introduce solid matter (tofu, bamboo). Reduce thermal output to simmer state.

5. Execute simmer cycle for 15 minutes.

6. Terminate heat. Garnish with basil immediately before consumption.
