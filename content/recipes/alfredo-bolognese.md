## Synthesis Protocol

1. If have not done so, mince and prepare garlic cloves, carrots, celery, and onions. 

1. Place large pot on stovetop and turn heat to medium-high. Add high heat cooking oil like Ghee.
		Place ground meat into large pot. As soon as the meat starts to brown, drop the minced garlic into the pot and begin stirring.

1. Once meat has mostly browned, sprinkle the chili flakes, herbs, salt, and pepper into the pot and stir to combine and let sit for 1 minute.

1. Stir the onion, carrots, and celery into the mixture. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring after 3.

1. Add the alfredo suace and stir into mix and heat until bubbling. Cover, reduce to simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.

## Mission Notes

This recipe can also be made with traditional marinara sauce, but I like alfredo as something different. I usually will serve this over some form of gluten free pasta.
My favorites are red lentil and the Thrive Market fusilli chickpea pasta.
